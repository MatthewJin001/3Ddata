# Usage
There are 224 images along with the poses from robotic base to the end-effector. The users can first obtain the intrinsic paramters of the camera by method from Zhengyou Zhang 2000 and then compute the camera-chessboard transformation by PnP.

# Miscellaneous
The distance between two checkerboard squares in row or column is 30mm.
